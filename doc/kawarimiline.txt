    To use this plugin, `img2sixel` is required.

INTERFACE                                             *kawarimiline-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS                                             *kawarimiline-functions*

kawarimiline#start({opts})                              *kawarimiline#start()*

    Start kawarimiline.
    {opts} is a dictionary with these fields:
      - size                                          *kawarimiline-opts-size*
        (REQUIRED)
        Vertical size of kawarimiline.
        This should be your terminal's font size plus a little padding.
        You have to specify this because Vim can't detect it.
      - left_margin                            *kawarimiline-opts-left_margin*
        (REQUIRED)
        Left margin of kawarimiline.
        |Number| or |Funcref| are supported.
      - right_margin                          *kawarimiline-opts-right_margin*
        (REQUIRED)
        Right margin of kawarimiline.
        |Number| or |Funcref| are supported.
      - enable                                      *kawarimiline-opts-enable*
        (default: v:true)
        Flag if show kawarimiline.
        |Boolean| or |Funcref| are supported.
      - interval                                  *kawarimiline-opts-interval*
        (default: 400)
        Wait time (in milliseconds) between each frame.
        Set this to 0 to stop the animation.
      - wave                                          *kawarimiline-opts-wave*
        (default: v:false)
        Flag if show waving rainbow.

    If you use Funcref to `'enable'`, `'left_margin'` or `'right_margin'`,
    they will be calculated every redraw.
    Be careful not to slow down the process and not to cause error.

    example:
>
    call kawarimiline#start({
          \ 'size': 22,
          \ 'left_margin': {->max([
          \   stridx(kawarimiline#get_statusline(), '   ') + 2,
          \   20
          \ ])},
          \ 'right_margin': 20,
          \ 'enable': {->winnr() == winnr('1h') && winnr() == winnr('1l')},
          \ 'wave': v:true,
          \ })
<

kawarimiline#stop()                                      *kawarimiline#stop()*

    Stop and hide kawarimiline.

kawarimiline#get_statusline()                  *kawarimiline#get_statusline()*

    Return current statusline as |String|.
    It is useful to calculate |kawarimiline-opts-left_margin| or
    |kawarimiline-opts-right_margin|.

FAQ                                                         *kawarimiline-faq*

Image is not displayed~

    This plugin checks whether `img2sixel` can be executed, but it can not
    confirm whether your terminal supports sixel.
    Run `img2sixel /path/to/image` and make sure the image is displayed.

    https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel

Image is accidentally hidden~

    When terminal is redrawen, e.g. using |CTRL-L|, the image is hidden.
    This is limitation of sixel graphic.
    When the |kawarimiline-opts-interval| elapses (in animation is enabled) or
    the cursor is moved (in animation is disabled), the image is redisplayed.

    In addition, kawarimiline is not updated in these conditions:
      - calculated left margin is less than 0
      - calculated righ margin is less than 0
      - calculated left margin and right margin are overlapped
      - cursor is in |cmdline|

Cursor is blinking~

    When animation is enabled, this plugin repeatedly do below:
      - moves the cursor onto the status line
      - displays an image at the cursor position
      - returns cursor to its original position

    This may cause the cursor to blink.
    It's possibly fixed by adjusting |kawarimiline-opts-interval|.
